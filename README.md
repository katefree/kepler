###Project Kepler: compile-time metaprogramming for Scala

Recent advances in compile-time metaprogramming gave birth to powerful and enjoyable approaches to software development. Nemerle programming language has showed that it is both possible and practical to provide a full-fledged macro facility for a mainstream programming platform.

Project Kepler represents an ongoing research in metaprogramming. It's about bringing type-safe and expressive compile-time metaprogramming facilities to Scala. And, of course, it's also about having fun for the sake of greater good!
